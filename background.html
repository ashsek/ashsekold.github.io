<h2><u><b>My Background:</b></u></h2>
<hr>
<p>Recently, I worked with Prof. David Tse at Stanford University. Initially, I was planning to visit him, but the plans were affected due to COVID-19 related travel restrictions. He was really kind to advise me virtually and also allowed me to attend his graduate-level course on Scaling Blockchains offered at Stanford University. For the project, we explored how certain protocols achieve the notion of fairness and methods for incentivizing them under rational adversaries. Before that, during the summers of 2019, I worked as a Visiting Scholar under Prof. Srinivasan Keshav at the University of Waterloo, Canada. There I worked on implementing a byzantine fault-tolerant membership service for the RCanopus consensus protocol. I used Concord-BFT to achieve Byzantine fault tolerance and Couchdb as a local database to store items after the successful consensus. We were successfully able to integrate the membership service with RCanopus using gRPCs.

<p>Previously (2018), I worked as a student research associate with Prof. Sandeep Shukla at the Interdisciplinary Center for Cyber Security and Cyber Defense of Critical Infrastructures (C3I center) at IIT Kanpur, India. I worked on hyperledger fabric based on blockchain technology to solve the double-spending problem in the Indian land registration for the state of Uttar Pradesh, India. Automating this process was essential to tackle corruption, a big problem in this domain, and hard because of the distributed nature and scalability. I presented a poster of this work at 3rd winter school in computer science and engineering on blockchains and cryptocurrencies at Israel Institute for Advanced Studies in Jerusalem, Israel, and later a paper at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay.
